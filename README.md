# Steel City Brews
---

## Project Purpose:

This is my submission for Project 5 of the [Udacity Front End Developer 
Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). Steel City Brews shows a map of Breweries and GastroPubs located in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.   It was built for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program using the React framework. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app and integration of third-party APIs into a React app.

The map is generated using the Google Maps API.  The list of breweries/gastropubs is generated by a call to the Foursquare API. A second API request is made when a location is clicked to get details about the brewery/gastropub, including address, phone, price point, user tip and an image. A link to the restaurant's Foursquare page is provided for more information.
